Release 1.0a2, Nov 9, 2009
==========================

Fixed bug #1: Does not work on Windows

Also:

  - Added .py suffixes to testall and testdoc scripts so that Windows
    recognizes them as Python scripts.
  - Changed the version info appended to the name testall and testdoc to
    testall_26.py to make the names legal Python identifiers.
  - Added find_root function in doctest_tools.setpath to find the root
    directory without putting it on sys.path.

You should remove the testall, testdoc, testall-x.y and testdoc-x.y scripts
from your system when upgrading to this release.
