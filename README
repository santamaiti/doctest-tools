This is the README file for the doctest-tools package.

To install this package, download and unpack the source package and then:

sudo python setup.py install

If you have multiple versions of python installed, you can run install once
for each version:

sudo python2.5 setup.py install
sudo python setup.py install    # for example, if 'python' is the 2.6 version
sudo python3.1 setup.py install

These will install two programs: testdoc.py and testall.py onto your system
for each version of python.  The python version number is appended to each
name: testdoc_25.py, testdoc_26.py, testdoc_31.py and the same for testall.
In addition, the version installed with just 'python' (with no version suffix)
will install testdoc.py and testall.py without version suffixes (in addition to
copies with the version suffix matching your default 'python' program).

The testdoc.py program runs the doctests in one file.  If the file passed ends
in .py, pyc or .pyo, it runs doctest.testmod, otherwise it runs
doctest.testfile.  In ether case it determines the proper directories to
add to the "Python path" so that the tests will find the proper versions of
needed modules.  Also when testing files that are not Python modules, it does
an os.chdir to the directory containing the file.

The testall.py program recursively looks for files with .py, .tst or .txt
suffixes (or the list of suffixes you provide to it) and runs testdoc.py on
each file in a separate process (so that tests do not cross contaminate each
other).  A final summary of the number of files, tests and errors is printed
along with a list of all of the files that had errors.

These programs are covered under the "MIT License" (see the LICENSE file
included in the source directory).
